# SailfishOS Chum - Getting Started with OBS

This document summarises the proces of building your first package on 
OBS.  It only skims the surface of OBS and is not a manual.

To start building your packages on OBS you will require an account.
Follow the process in the README and contact 'lbt' for an account to 
be set up.

When your account is set up, you will have a "Home Project".  This is where
you can start creating packages.  The URL for your home project will be:
https://build.sailfishos.org/project/show/home:<username>

## Creating a package on OBS

Projects contain packages which are built against target repositories
(sailfish versions, not source/git respoitories).

### Prerequisites

To build on OBS, the source repository must contain a .spec file for building the RPM.
This will generally be the case for projects created using the Sailfish SDK.  The name
of the .spec should also match the package name below and be in the rpm/ subfolder.

### Creating a Package

To create your first package, perform the following steps:

1. Click "Create Package"
2. On the new package page, give the package a name and click "Save Changes"
   * eg harbour-mypackage
3. You now need to add files to the package to allow OBS to get the source and
build it.  Create a file on your computer called `_service` with the following content:
    ```
    <services>
        <service name="tar_git">
        <param name="url">URL TO PROJECT</param>
        <param name="branch">master</param>
        <param name="revision"></param>
        </service>
    </services>
    ```
   And specify at least the URL.  If you want to build another branch, change the 
   branch name, and if you want to build a particular revision, specify a git hash
   or tag in the revision.
4. Back on OBS, click "Add File" then "Browse" and select the `_service` file you
   just created and "Save Changes"
5. If all goes well, OBS will fetch the source code.

## Adding target repositories

Back at the home project on OBS, you will require target repositories to build against.
These can be added using a UI but it is easier to add them manually.

1. Click "Advanced" and "Meta"<br>
   Note, don't confuse this with the package Meta configuration, the names are the same.
2. You will be presented with an XML description of the target repositories.  Between
   the ```<project> </project>``` tags, add the following:
    ```
    <repository name="sailfish_latest_i486">
        <path project="sailfishos:latest" repository="latest_i486"/>
        <arch>i586</arch>
    </repository>
    <repository name="sailfish_latest_armv7hl">
        <path project="sailfishos:latest" repository="latest_armv7hl"/>
        <arch>armv8el</arch>
    </repository>
    <repository name="sailfish_latest_aarch64">
        <path project="sailfishos:latest" repository="latest_aarch64"/>
        <arch>aarch64</arch>
    </repository>
    <repository name="sailfish_4.1.0.24_armv7hl">
        <path project="sailfishos:4.1.0.24" repository="latest_armv7hl"/>
        <arch>armv8el</arch>
    </repository>
    <repository name="sailfish_4.1.0.24_aarch64">
        <path project="sailfishos:4.1.0.24" repository="latest_aarch64"/>
        <arch>aarch64</arch>
    </repository>
    <repository name="sailfish_4.1.0.24_i486">
        <path project="sailfishos:4.1.0.24" repository="latest_i486"/>
        <arch>i586</arch>
    </repository>
    ```
   This will create build targets for the 4.1 and latest SaifishOS releases for
   all supported architectures.
3. Click "Save Changes", navigate back to the project overview, and you should see
   the build status for each target on the right hand side.
4. You can click on the package name, and then click on the build target status to
   see the current build log.
  
## Submitting your package to sailfishos:chum:testing

Once you are happy your builds are working, you can submit it for inclusion to chum:testing.

1. Navigate to the package, and click "Submit Package"
2. Enter the target project as `sailfishos:chum:testing`
3. Click Ok

For packages submitted to chum, please specify a particular git revision to be built (sha or tag)
and do not use webhooks, so that packages in chum do not automatically update.
For this reason, you may want to set up your home project with builds for your master
branch for personal use, and a specific revision to be submitted to chum.

Please ensure that the license specified in the .spec matches that of the source repository
and that it follows the format used in https://github.com/sailfishos/rpmlint/blob/master/rpm/sailfish.toml#L152

## Other useful notes

* You can create sub-projects in your home project to group builds together
* You can add the repository for the builds to your device using `zypper ar` to install
  on your device
* To re-trigger OBS to download the latest code, click the "Trigger Service" link in the package
* You can configure OBS to not build certain packages against certain repositories, or disable
  certain projects from being published.  It is very flexible.  This is available from the "Repositories"
  link.
* OBS will resolve dependencies during the build if packages are available in either the current project or 
  the build target.  If you want to build a package in your home project against other packages which are only
  in chum (or another repository), then that can be added to the repository configuration with code such 
  as the following in the project "Meta" configuration:
```
  <repository name="sailfish_latest_armv7hl">
    <path project="sailfishos:latest" repository="latest_armv7hl"/>
    <path project="sailfishos:chum" repository="4.1.0.24_armv7hl"/>
    <arch>armv8el</arch>
  </repository>
```
